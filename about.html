     This <a href="main.html">website</a> is inspired by a deeply personal journey...
     <br>
In 2020, my mother was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, necessitating weekly blood tests. 
Driven by a desire to support her, I envisioned an application that could not only record these blood tests 
but also clearly visualize their trends over time. My hope is that this site will extend its support to 
others enduring similar challenges, offering a tool that can help in their journey. 
If you have suggestions for further improvements, please don't hesitate to contact me. 
Thank you for your support and interest.
