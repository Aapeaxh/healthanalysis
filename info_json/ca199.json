"data":["A CA 19-9 test measures the amount of a protein called CA 19-9 (cancer antigen 19-9) in a sample of your blood. ",
"CA 19-9 is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in your body.",
"Healthy people can have small amounts of CA 19-9 in their blood. High levels of CA 19-9 are often a sign of pancreatic cancer.",
"But high levels can also be a sign of other types of cancer or certain conditions that aren't cancer. For example, gallstones and cirrhosis of the liver can cause high CA 19-9 levels.",
"Because high levels of CA 19-9 can mean different things, the test is not used by itself to screen for or diagnose cancer or other diseases. But it can help monitor your cancer and check how well your treatment is working."]
